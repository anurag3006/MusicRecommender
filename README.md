# Music Recommender
# This is basically a music recommendation model. Here the user choose a song from the list and clicks on the "Recommend" button and he/she is suggested a list of recommended songs.

Along with the model. A dataset was also created **music_link_image** which is basically inlcudes spotify links of album images and song links.
These links were collected with the Spotify API.
